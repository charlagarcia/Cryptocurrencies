# Cryptocurrencies
Using unsupervised machine learning to analyze cryptocurrency and choose from a tradable list.

## Overview
1. Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.
2. Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
3. Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
4. Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
5. Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.
